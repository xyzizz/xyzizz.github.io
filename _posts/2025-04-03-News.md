# 本周AI要闻：你必须知道的10大AI新闻

AI had a busy week, with announcements ranging from OpenAI’s new task-performing agent to Tencent’s advances in 3D design. DeepSeek, a free open-source AI model that has been making waves since December, continues to challenge industry leaders like OpenAI and Meta by offering comparable performance at a fraction of the cost. The Chinese AI startup recently launched DeepSeek-R1, a reasoning model positioned as a compelling alternative to OpenAI’s o1 model. Not to be outdone by OpenAI and Anthropic, Perplexity AI this week officially launched its Assistant for Android, bringing a versatile tool designed to simplify everyday life. Doubao 1.5 Pro is an upgraded AI model designed to enhance reasoning and performance, directly competing with industry leaders like GPT-4o.

# 四大会计师事务所押注能完成所有工作并"解放"员工的AI代理

Deloitte's platform, Zora AI, provides clients with a selection of "intelligent digital workers" or agents that can perceive, reason, and act to complete tasks autonomously, Deloitte said in a press release. Jason Girzadas, Deloitte's US CEO, said Agentic AI represented the beginning of "the autonomous enterprise era" and would transform work and business models. Before achieving the vast transformational potential that proponents promise AI agents will deliver, Big Four firms and other businesses must first work out how to manage the new digital class of workers and how best to integrate new solutions into their business models. David Rowlands, KPMG's global head of AI, told BI that the firm is weaving AI agents into the way it delivers services for clients, using them as "innovative digital team-mates working closely with our brilliant people in Audit, Tax and Advisory."
