# Hugging Face clones OpenAI's Deep Research in 24 hours

On Tuesday, Hugging Face researchers released an open source AI research agent called "Open Deep Research," created by an in-house team as a challenge 24 hours after the launch of OpenAI's Deep Research feature, which can autonomously browse the web and create research reports. After only a day's work, Hugging Face's Open Deep Research has reached 55.15 percent accuracy on the General AI Assistants (GAIA) benchmark, which tests an AI model's ability to gather and synthesize information from multiple sources.

**中文翻译**: 周二，Hugging Face的研究人员发布了一个名为“Open Deep Research”的开源AI研究代理，该代理由内部团队在OpenAI的Deep Research功能发布24小时后作为挑战创建，该功能可以自主浏览网页并创建研究报告。仅经过一天的工作，Hugging Face的Open Deep Research在通用AI助手（GAIA）基准测试中达到了55.15%的准确率，该基准测试评估AI模型从多个来源收集和综合信息的能力。

# DeepSeek, next-generation AI agents may erode value of large models

DeepSeek and next-generation AI agents could erode the value of language models. Large language models like those developed by Microsoft-backed firm OpenAI are set to become commoditized this year amid rapid advances toward next-generation artificial intelligence agents and more nimble, open-source rivals, according to top tech executives.
